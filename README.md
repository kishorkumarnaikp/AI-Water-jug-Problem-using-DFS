🚰💧 Water Jug Problem Solver using DFS 🌊🔍
Welcome to the Water Jug Problem Solver! This project showcases an algorithm to solve the classic water jug problem using Depth-First Search (DFS). 🌟

🌟 Problem Overview
Imagine you have two jugs with different capacities, and you need to measure out an exact amount of water. With our DFS-based solution, you can find out if it's possible to achieve your target amount! 🧩

🛠️ How It Works
States & Actions: Each state is represented by the water levels in both jugs. Possible actions include filling, emptying, and pouring between jugs. 🔄
DFS Exploration: We explore all possible states using a stack, ensuring we don't revisit states to avoid cycles. 🔍

✨ Features
Efficient Search: Leveraging DFS to explore potential solutions.
Customizable: Input your own jug capacities and target amount. 📝
